# NuMC
A simple practice project for learning how to use Monte Carlo methods for neutrino oscilations.

My current idea is that since we have some PDF which give the probability of a neutrino oscilating in matter, we can model a flux of neutrinos with mixed energies after a distance $L$ using Monte Carlo Methods


constants.h - contains masses, mixing angles, unit conversions etc...

## Neutrino Oscilations
Neutrino.h - base class that deals with the 3 weak eigenstates of the Neutrinos
nuElectron.h, nuMuon.h, nuTau.h the three Neutrino classes
MSW.h - deals with the Oscilations
